    3. If X1 ~ N(μ, σ2) and X2 ~ N(μ, σ2) are iid normal random variables, then what is the difference between 2 X1 and X1 + X2? Discuss both their distributions and parameters.   

Ans- As we know that if  X ∼ N(µ1, σ1^2 ), and  Y ∼ N(µ2, σ2^2 ) are two independent  random variables then   X + Y ∼ N(µ1 + µ2, σ1^2 + σ2^2 ) , and      X − Y ∼ N(µ1 − µ2, σ1^2 + σ2^2 ) .
Similarly if  Z = aX + bY , where X and Y are as defined above, i.e Z is linear combination of X and Y , then Z ∼ N(aµ1 + bµ2, a^2σ1^2 + b^2σ2^2 ).
Therefore in the question 
2X1~ N(2 u,4 σ^2) and 
X1+X2 ~  N(µ + µ, σ^2 + σ^2 ) ~ N(2 u, 2σ^2 )
2X1-(X1+X2) = N( 4µ,6 σ^2)
